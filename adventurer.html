          <p>Flying is one of the most ancient human dreams. And only in the last century or so did it go from fantasy to reality. So once I realized I could actually learn to fly, it felt almost irresponsible not to. I started training in Florida and Pennsylvania and have logged about 30 hours so far, mostly in Cessna 172s and 152s. I'm working toward my private pilot certificate and plan to go further: earn an instrument rating, maybe own my own plane one day, pick up a seaplane add-on, and eventually fly bush planes out into the wilderness to camp in places with no roads, just sky and forest.</p>
          <p>It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but what originally opened my eyes to flying was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OULGcSWoAc&ab_channel=JayS" target="_blank">a scene in the Fifty Shades of Grey trailer</a> that left an impression. Of course, I later learned that scene was actually in a glider — not an airplane — but by then it was too late. I was hooked. Flying is equal parts a useful skill, a way of experiencing true freedom, and a portal into a whole new frontier of adventure.</p>

        <p>Skydiving is something I'm still pretty new to. I did my first tandem jump a few years ago, but I really started taking it seriously after getting a vacation place in the Poconos. I picked the spot because it was across the street from a little airport I could fly out of. As it turned out, that same airport also had a skydiving center, and before long, I became friends with the instructors. We'd hang out on the weekends, and every time they'd ask, "So when are you going to learn to skydive?" Eventually I figured they were right. I should.</p>
        <p>So far I've done six jumps and I'm currently working my way through the AFF course. I've done two solos and have mostly been jumping around New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Right now, it's not even about the view. I'm still too focused to look around. It's about the raw adrenaline and the jolt of aliveness that hits the moment you step out of the plane. And it's about something deeper too. Each jump is a personal test, a practice in overcoming fear. Even now, I still get nervous standing at the edge of the door. But I do it anyway. And when my feet touch the ground, there's this unmistakable feeling — not just of survival, but of bravery earned in real time.</p>

        <p>I started riding motorcycles in 2018, back when I was living in San Francisco. The way I got into it is kind of funny. I was deep down a rabbit hole researching van life, dreaming about traveling to every U.S. national park in a van. At some point I thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if I could carry a motorcycle in the van to explore each park more easily?" (Yes, I know how silly that sounds now.) That thought led me to a bunch of motorcycle YouTube videos, which quickly turned into an obsession. Before long, I had a Ninja 400 and was riding across the Bay Bridge with the wind in my face and the skyline behind me.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite rides have been simple ones. Crossing from San Francisco to Berkeley at sunset was always its own kind of magic. But I've also taken bikes through the mountains of Medellín and up into the high-altitude roads of Ladakh, India. What draws me to motorcycling is mostly the adrenaline and the thrill. There's something raw about it. Your body is exposed to the world, your senses are alive, and your attention is completely present. You can actually feel the movement in a way you just never can in a car.</p>

        <p>I've been scuba diving since I was 14. I've probably done over 50 dives (though I do a really bad job of maintaining a logbook), in environments ranging from tropical islands to literal ice water. I'm currently Open Water certified and working on my Advanced Open Water.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite dives have been at Molokini Crater in Hawaii, gliding alongside manta rays in Bali, descending into the surreal freshwater cave systems of the Cenotes near Tulum, and sinking into the depths of the Blue Hole in Belize. That one stuck with me — it felt so deep and so dark that, for a moment, I felt like I was floating in the void.</p>
        <p>What draws me back every time is the weightlessness and the deep, almost meditative serenity of being underwater. It's like stepping into an alien world, where light bends differently, time slows down, and your entire field of attention narrows to the quiet rhythm of your breath.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I just like to lay back and watch the bubbles rise, drifting slowly toward the surface. Down there, everything is unfamiliar. Things that look hard are actually soft, and things that look soft are hard (yes, yes, I know I shouldn't be touching stuff). But it's that sense of wonder, of immersion in a completely different kind of reality, that makes diving feel like more than just a sport. It's a practice in presence, a reconnection with the natural world, and a kind of stillness I haven't found anywhere else.</p>

        <p>I got into skiing around high school, but really started falling in love with it during college. Even now, my college roommate and I still try to take ski trips whenever we can. I mostly stick to resorts and have been lucky to ski in some incredible places over the years. Some of my favorites are Niseko in Japan, Aspen in Colorado, and Banff up in the Canadian Rockies.</p>
        <p>I wouldn't call myself an advanced skier, but I can handle black diamonds at most resorts. As for double blacks… I've done a few, but usually just once. For me, those are solidly in the category of type 2 fun — more about surviving than carving. What I really love is the range skiing offers. There's the adrenaline rush of fast descents and technical terrain, but also the calm that comes with gliding through quiet glades. Sometimes the best part of the day is just cruising down a wide green trail, taking in the scenery.</p>
        <p>Lately I've started learning to snowboard too. I'm still very much a beginner, but it's been fun to approach the mountain from a new angle, even if that angle mostly involves falling.</p>

        <p>Kayaking is a bit different from most of my other adventures. It's quieter, calmer, and less of what people would call high-adrenaline, but it's still something I absolutely love. I've done all kinds of watercrafting over the years, from rafting to canoeing, but there's something uniquely satisfying about the simplicity and control of a single kayak. I want to go left, I go left. I want to go right, I go right. It's just me and the water, and that sense of total self-reliance feels incredibly freeing.</p>
        <p>I got into kayaking when I was young, mostly through Boy Scouts, and since then I've paddled through still lakes, river rapids, and open ocean, loving everything from the rush of whitewater to the slow, steady glide through winding mangrove tunnels. One of my most memorable moments wasn't about the destination at all. A close friend and I once spent hours drifting across a lake, just paddling and talking, completely immersed in the moment. And best of all, <a href="https://xkcd.com/209/" target="_blank">they can even travel through time</a>.</p>
